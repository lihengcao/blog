<p>I didn't like Jekyll that much. It has a lot of customization options, but I just needed something simple.</p>
<p>Eventually, almost embarassingly late, I had the realization that many programs just loop over everything. There's not some elegant symbolic solution. It's just a loop that manually[1] goes over everything and does what needs to be done.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I started a static site generator repo with the plan to also write a small markdown compiler (to html) in addition to everything else.</p>
<p>I lost interest in writing the md compiler, so the project stalled. Much later, I decided that I was still interested in the other parts of the project, so I used a library to do the markdown -&gt; html conversion but still did everything else.</p>
<p>[1]: Ok, I admit manually isn't the best way to describe it. Not sure what other word to use.</p>
