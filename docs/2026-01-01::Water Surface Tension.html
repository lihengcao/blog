<h1>Water Surface Tension</h1>
<p>Date: 2026-01-01</p>
<p>This post is a longstanding TODO for me. It's spent close to a year in the backlog.</p>
<p>I have a tea bottle with a built in strainer/filter. When the boggle is flipped rapidly, it seems there's some surface tension at play, and the water actually stays above the filter even if there's air below. See below!</p>
