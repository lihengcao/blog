<h1>Motivational brain dump</h1>

<p>This is a brain dump of some motivational phrases and tactics.</p>
<h2>10 minute rule</h2>
<p>Telling myself to just try something for 10 minutes and that I can quit or go for a walk afterwards if I don't feel like it seems to work for me. I end up doing things for longer.</p>
<h3>Starting small</h3>
<p>It's ok to take time to ramp up. If I don't want to do everything, then I can just do a little.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is making a lot of commits. It makes a small amount of work feel like a lot (and is good general practice), which sounds like a bad thing, but it's better than no work and if you keep it up, it'll eventually result in a lot of work.</p>
