<h1>Migrate bookshelf to blog</h1>
<p>
  As of writing, I have a small
  <a href="https://lihengcao.github.io/sections/bookshelf.html"
    >bookshelf section</a
  >
  on my <a href="https://lihengcao.github.io/">personal site</a> to keep track
  of what books I've read, i.e., learning in public. I started adding cool
  articles and blogs to there as well.
</p>
<p>
  I made the bookshelf page before I made the blog/static site generator, so it
  was simply an html file with tables and rows. But now, I do have a site
  generator, and since I'm the person who made it, I can control what kind of
  site it generates. I'll add that feature sometime and migrate things over.
