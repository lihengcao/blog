Earlier this year, I was moving out and so I sold many of my things on Facebook Marketplace. Since I was listing my items, I also happened to view many postings; This is probably by design.

I've never had any kind of gaming console before, so when I saw a cheap Nintendo Switch on Marketplace that also came with some games, I decided to buy it. I ended up playing the included for a bit, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Instead of selling the device and games together, I thought it would be funny to see if I could "profit" (very low hourly rate) from this. I sold the games and the switch separately, and came out about $25 on top if you don't factor in time or free transit (unlimited card).

So there's a story about my first flip at the young age of 23.
