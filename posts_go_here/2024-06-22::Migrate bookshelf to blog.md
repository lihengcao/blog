As of writing, I have a small [bookshelf section](https://lihengcao.github.io/sections/bookshelf.html) on my [personal site](https://lihengcao.github.io/) to keep track of what books I've read, i.e., learning in public. I started adding cool articles and blogs to there as well.

I made the bookshelf page before I made the blog/static site generator, so it was simply an html file with tables and rows. But now, I do have a site generator, and since I'm the person who made it, I can control what kind of site it generates. I'll add that feature sometime and migrate things over.
