This is not a fully original thought by me. It's a amalgamation [^1] of many self-help, productivity, and maybe even game dev content. And physics, of course.

IIUC: The wave function is a concept from quantum physics. In that world, "things" are in a state of superposition when they aren't being observed, meaning that they can many possible states they can be in, and you can't be sure until you observe it.

How does this relate with productivity and self help? When you take an action, you can only see the immediate result. You have to take more action in order to concretely know about the effects. This then ties in with "doing things fast" by encouraging quick and further action to get all the results instead of doing a small action and being content with not knowing the rest of the "state."
